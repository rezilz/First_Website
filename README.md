# My First Personal Website
The first personal website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS as part of the Web Technology curriculum. 
I've used sitemaps, storyboards, and process flows to illustrate design concepts. In addition, this website must provide the following teaching objectives:

- The getDay() method retrieves the current weekday.
- The getMonth() method is used to retrieve the month of a date.
- Show pleasant morning, afternoon, and night according to the hour.
- The font color of the passage in the contact tab must vary as you click or hold the mouse.

- Validate the following on the contact tab:
  - Fullname: If left blank, a warning box appears. If not blank, the typeface is changed to uppercase.
  - Age: If the data is not numeric and contains two characters, a warning box will appear.
  - Mobile: The data must be numeric, contain ten characters, and begin with the letter '0.'
  - Email: Verify that the email component contains @ and that there is a. (dot) after @ with a warning message box.
